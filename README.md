# Final-Project-LITA-Capstone
This project serve as an assessment of my Data Journey with the Incubator Hub

## Project Title: TobbyOkky Store Analysis 

## Project Overview:
This project aims to analyze and visualize the sales performance of a retail store to uncover key insights, including top-selling products, regional sales trends, and monthly performance. The ultimate goal is to create an interactive Power BI dashboard that presents these insights clearly, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions based on data. 

## Data Source: 
Excel Files: Which contains information on individual sales transactions, including product names, categories, transaction dates, sales regions, and customer details.

## Tools Used:
- Microsoft Excel [Download here](http://microsoft.com): Used for initial data cleaning, exploration, and analysis. In this project, Excel allowed us to summarize sales and customer data with pivot tables, calculate metrics like average revenue, and generate basic reports for quick insights.

- SQL: SQL queries were used to extract, aggregate, and analyze data from the database. SQL provided answers to specific business questions, such as identifying top-selling products, calculating monthly sales, and segmenting customer subscriptions.
  
- Power BI: It serves as the primary data visualization tool, where findings from Excel and SQL analyses were transformed into interactive dashboards. Power BIâ€™s visualizations presented insights on sales trends, customer segments, and regional performance, allowing for dynamic exploration with slicers and filters.

- GitHub: It used to stored project files, such as SQL scripts, Excel workbooks, and Power BI dashboards, and maintained a README file documenting the project overview, data sources, and steps. GitHub enabled easy sharing and building portofolio.

## Objective:
The objective of this project is to provide actionable insights into sales performance and customer behavior, supporting data-driven decisions for business growth and customer retention. Through this project, the business can gain a deeper understanding of both sales performance and customer behavior, guiding strategic decisions to drive growth, enhance customer satisfaction, and maximize revenue. 

## Data Cleaning and Preparation:
- Remove Duplicates: Checked both sales and customer data tables for any duplicate rows and removed them to maintain data accuracy.
- Handle Missing Values:(e.g., filling with averages, using 'Unknown' for missing categories, or removing incomplete records).
- Standardize Formats: Standardized date, currency, and text formats to ensure consistency across the dataset (e.g., all dates in MM/DD/YYYY format, currency in USD).
